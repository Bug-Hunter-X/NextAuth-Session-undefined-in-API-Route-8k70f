# NextAuth Session Issue in API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug where the NextAuth session object is sometimes undefined in an API route, even when the user is successfully logged in.  The issue appears to be intermittent and difficult to reproduce reliably.  The solution involves checking for a null session before accessing session data.
